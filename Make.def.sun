# Common make definitions for SunOS make under SunOS 4.1.[12].

# Definitions required in all program directories to compile and link
# C programs using gcc.  We also have to get rid of Sun's "-target" options,
# as gcc doesn't grok it.

# We don't normally use -O with gcc on the sparc.
# -I/home/stevens/include is to find the Sun headers that I've modified
#		to be more ANSI & POSIX-1990 compliant.
# We need the -I/usr/include so that gcc goes there for files
#		such as <limits.h> which are also in the gcc-include/
#		directory (which aren't correct for ANSI C).
NOANSICFLAGS = -I/home/stevens/include -I/usr/include
# We need this because Sun's <sys/wait.h> ain't ANSI C.
